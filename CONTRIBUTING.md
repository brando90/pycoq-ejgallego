## Contributing to pyCoq

Thanks for willing to contribute to PyCoq! Contributing is usually as
easy as opening a pull request, issue, or dropping by the Zulip
channel and letting us know what you think of the tool.

Nothing special has to be kept in mind, other than standard OCaml
practice, we usually follow `ocp-indent` guidelines, but we are
liberal in some places in particular with regards to intra-line
indentation.

For Python, we need yet to determine style and coding recommendations.

We prefer GPG signed commits as well as `Signed-off-by` commits.

### Commit tag conventions [work in progress]:

We have some soft conventions 

- [ocaml]  : Related
- [python]  : Adding or modifying a test.
- [build]   : Build system
- [doc]     : Documentation.
- [test]    : Adding or modifying a test.
